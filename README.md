# DEGEN Token Contract

DEGEN is an ERC-20 token contract that provides basic functionalities for a gaming platform. It allows the platform to create and distribute new tokens as rewards to players, enables token transfers between players, and supports token redemption for in-game items. Additionally, players can check their token balances and burn tokens they no longer need.

1. Minting new tokens: The platform owner can create new tokens and distribute them to players as rewards.

2. Transferring tokens: Players can transfer their tokens to other addresses on the platform.

3. Redeeming tokens: Players can redeem their tokens for items in the in-game store. The redemption logic is handled by an external contract called GameStore.

4. Checking token balance: Players can check their token balance at any time using the getBalance function.

5. Burning tokens: Players can burn (destroy) tokens they own but no longer need, making them permanently unrecoverable.
